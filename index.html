    <p>And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to Heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't wanna go home right now
And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later, it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am I love you too much
To live without you loving me back
I love you too much
Heaven's my witness and this is a fact
I know I belong
When I sing this song
There's love above love and it's ours
'Cause I love you too much
I live for your touch
I whisper your name night after night
I love you too much
There's only one feeling and I know it's right
I know I belong
When I sing this song
There's love above love and it's ours
'Cause I love you too much
Heaven knows your name I've been praying
To have you come here by my side
Without you a part of me's missing
Just to make you my home, I will fight
I know I belong
When I sing this song
There's love above love and it's ours
'Cause I love you too much
I love you too much
I love you too much
Heaven's my witness and this is a fact
You live in my soul
Your heart is my goal
There's love above love and it's mine 'cause I love you
There's love above love and it's yours 'cause I love you
There's love above love and it's ours
If you love me as much And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to Heaven that I'll ever be

Remember the first day when you smiled at me?
You stepped to me and then you said to me
I was the woman you dreamed about
Remember the first day when you called my house?
Remember the first day when you took me out?
We had butterflies, although we tried to hide
And we both had a beautiful night
The way we held each other's hand
The way we talked, the way we laughed
It felt so good to find true love
I knew right then and there you were the one, ooh
I know that he loves me 'cause he told me so
I know that he loves me 'cause his feelings show
When he stares at me, you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me 'cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me 'cause it's me he trusts
And he's missing me if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me, his brown eyes tell it so
Remember the first day, the first day we kissed?
Remember the first day we had an argument?
We apologized and then we compromised
And we haven't argued since
Remember the first day we stopped playing games?
Remember the first day you fell in love with me?
It felt so good for you to say those words
'Cause I felt the same way too
The way we held each other's hands
The way we talked, the way we laughed
It felt so good to fall in love

And he's missing me if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me, his brown eyes tell it so
I'm so happy, so happy that you're in my life
And baby, now that you're a part of me
You've shown me
Shown me the true meaning of love (the true meaning of love)
And I know he loves me
I know that he loves me 'cause he told me so
I know that he loves me 'cause his feelings show

Filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
You've been locked in here forever, and you just can't say goodbye
Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms
You've been hiding them in hollowed-out pianos left in the dark
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
You've been locked in here forever, and you just can't say goodbye
Your lips, my lips
Apocalypse
Your lips, my lips
Apocalypse
Go and sneak us through the rivers
Flood is rising up on your knees
Oh, please
Come out and haunt me, I know you want me
Come out and haunt me
Sharing all your secrets with each other, since you were kids
Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you clutched in your fist
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
You've been locked in here forever, and you just can't say goodbye
You've been locked in here forever, and you just can't say goodbye
Oh, when you're all alone
I will reach for you
When you're feeling low
I will be there too Coming back to just me and You
Just a heart song singing out of tune
I remember the simplicity
Just to feel You here was everything
Stunned by Your beauty
This is my offering
Not for anything that I could gain
Just to honor You and bring You praise
Like a fragrance broken on the floor
May my worship be pure
There's no motive, there's no hidden catch
Here's my all and I don't want it back
Like a fragrance broken on the floor
May my worship be pure
Find me like a child again
Full of wonder, full of innocence
Before anythin' got in the way
Any dream or any accolade
You make it easy
Easy to bring me
Not for anything that I could gain
Just to honor You and bring You praise
Like a fragrance broken on the floor
May my worship be pure
There's no motive, there's no hidden catch
Here's my all and I don't want it back
Like a fragrance broken on the floor
May my worship be pure
Pure thanks, pure praise
Nothing in the way
My heart, my love
This is all You want
This is all You want
This is all You want
Oh, Jesus, this is for You
Oh, Jesus, this is only for You
And it's all about, all about You, all about You
And it's all about, all about You, all about You
And it's all about, all about You, all about You
And it's all about You, yeah
All about You, all about You
And it's all about, all about You, all about You
And it's all about, all about You, all about You
And it's all about You
Not for anything that I could gain
Just to honor You and bring You praise
Like a fragrance broken on the floor
May my worship be pure
There's no motive, there's no hidden catch
Here's my all and I don't want it back
Like a fragrance broken on the floor
Let my worship be pure Track suits and red wine
Movies for two
We'll take off our phones
And we'll turn off our shoes
We'll play Nintendo
Though I always lose
'Cause you'll watch the TV
While I'm watching you
There's not many people
I'd honestly say
I don't mind losing to
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
Dumb conversations
We lose track of time
Have I told you lately
I'm grateful you're mine?
We'll watch "The Notebook"
For the seventeenth time
I'll say, it's stupid
Then you'll catch me crying
We're not making out
On a boat in the rain
Or in a house I've painted blue
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
So shut all the windows
And lock all the doors
We're not looking for no one
Don't need nothing more
You'll bite my lip and
I'll want you more
Until we end up
In a heap on the floor
You could be dancing on tabletops
Wearing high-heels
Drinking until the world
Spins like a wheel
But tonight your apartment
Had so much appeal
Who needs stars?
We've got a roof
And there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
No, there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you Will it be a pavement or a sidewalk
When I finally lay my eyes on you?
Someone I've already loved
will you find your way out of the blue?
Will it be my flat or your apartment
When I finally realize I do?
Will we meet on Baker Street
Or find ourselves on Melrose Avenue?
I don't know who you are
But I'll save you a seat
Hang my coat on a chair next to me
I tried to reassure the waiter
Say you're down the street
He laughed at me
So here's to you
The most beautiful thing that I have never seen
Someone on a screen asked me a question
Something about what love means to me
Maybe it's just circumstance
Or general compatibility
I don't know who you are
But I'll save you a seat
Hang my coat on a chair next to me
I tried to reassure the waiter
Say you're down the street
He laughed at me
So here's to you
The most beautiful thing that I have never seen I love you too much
To live without you loving me back
I love you too much
Heaven's my witness and this is a fact
I know I belong
When I sing this song
There's love above love and it's ours
'Cause I love you too much
I live for your touch
I whisper your name night after night
I love you too much
There's only one feeling and I know it's right
I know I belong
When I sing this song
There's love above love and it's ours
'Cause I love you too much
Heaven knows your name I've been praying
To have you come here by my side
Without you a part of me's missing
Just to make you my home, I will fight
I know I belong
When I sing this song
There's love above love and it's ours
'Cause I love you too much
I love you too much
I love you too much
Heaven's my witness and this is a fact
You live in my soul
Your heart is my goal
There's love above love and it's mine 'cause I love you
There's love above love and it's yours 'cause I love you
There's love above love and it's ours
If you love me as much</p>
